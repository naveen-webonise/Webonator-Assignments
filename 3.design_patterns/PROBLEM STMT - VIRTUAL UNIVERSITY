PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY DESIGN AND DESIGN PATTERNS USED

1)Different students use different payment gateway for payment of fees.
So in order to provide a common interface for payment, Factory Method
pattern is made use of while designing.

2)Students would require the study materials or the certificates
to be either mailed online or through any postal service.
In order to provide them a common interface by hiding the implementation 
details, Factory Method pattern is made use of while designing.
