MongoDB is schema-less database unlike MySQL which follows a schema which has constraints
associated with it.
MongoDB is very flexible which can meet the changing design schema which is essential
for the modern data which is changing.
MongoDB has one or more collections in a single database. Each document
in a collection has a unique object ID associated with it.
